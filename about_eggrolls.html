            <br>
            <u><strong>All Natural</strong></u>
            <p>"On a Roll" egg rolls are handcrafted <em>only with fresh, whole ingredients.</em>
              We have made it our calling not to use any preservative or artificial flavouring in any of our product.<br><br>
              In fact, our insistence on not using any unnatural chemical extends even to food colouring; "On a Roll" egg rolls are as <strong>au naturel</strong> as they get.
              <br><br>
              <u><strong>Not Your Typical Egg Rolls!</strong></u><br>
              <!-- Designed to be eaten chilled, our filled egg rolls provide a truly unique and pleasurable experience.               -->
              Somewhere between the hard crisp of a biscuit and the soft chewiness of a crepe, there is a happy middle ground where "On a Roll" egg rolls reside.<br><br>
              The unique mouthfeel and texture of a "On a Roll" egg roll, can be best described as a <em>"flaky cake with a slight crisp."</em><br><br>
              This might change the way you look at egg rolls!
              <br><br>
              <!-- <u><strong>We Go To Great Lengths For You</strong></u><br>
                From end to end, each "On a Roll" egg roll measures at an impressive and hefty 190 mm. Combined that with a thickness of our design,
                a single "On a Roll" egg roll paired with your favourite hot beverage, is the perfect snack anytime of the day.
                <br><br>
                However, size means nothing if our egg rolls do not taste good.
                <br><br>
                In that regard, it was never our intention to simply numb our customers with dull, overwhelming sweetness.
                While "On a Roll" egg rolls are <em>just</em> sweet enough, our customers can savour the fragrance of the top-quality French butter and fresh eggs that we use in our product.
                <br><br>
                <u><strong>Lovingly Rolled by Hand...One at a Time</strong></u><br>
                Unlike most baked goods which can be produced <em>en masse</em> on a single tray in an oven, egg rolls making is a very laborious job.
                <br><br>
                Every "On a Roll" egg roll is lovingly produced by hand, one at a time. While it is an extremely time-consuming process, we would not want it any other way for our customers. -->
              <!-- <br><br>With our variety of our delicately flavoured and gently sweeten cream fillings, you will want to <em>keep on rolling</em>, there is no stopping at one! -->

              <p>“ON A ROLL”<br><em>idiom</em><br><br>
                <em>definition</em><br>
                Experiencing a particularly successful period, without any setbacks or low points.<br><br>
                <em>phrase</em><br>
                If someone is on a roll, they are having great success which seems likely to continue.

            <div class="about_section_paragraph alt_font">
              <h3 class="about_section_paragraph_subheader"><strong>Our Logo</strong></h3>
              <p>The inspiration for logo is derived from the idea of a rolling snowball, constantly growing in size as it progresses along its path.
                <br><br>
                By giving the initial idea of a rolling snowball a more distinctive shape (of an egg) combined with a bright yellow colour (of the yolk), the end result is a blatant representation of a "golden egg rolling and growing".
