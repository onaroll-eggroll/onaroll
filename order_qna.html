            <p>We understand that you might want to send friends and families a gift of "On a Roll" egg rolls and time is especially crucial for our freshly made egg rolls,
              as it is essential to have them delivered as soon as possible to allow the recipients ample time to enjoy our egg rolls within 7 days from the delivery date.
              <br><br>
              With that in mind, we have made the decision to outsource delivery of our egg rolls to the food delivery professionals for maximum island-wide coverage.
              For this logistic efficiency, "On a Roll" is charged for every delivery to an address made by the delivery professionals.

              <br><br> As much as we would like to offer free delivery to <em>all</em> of our valued customers, being a small-scale operation, we simply cannot afford to do so. We seek your kind understanding.

            <ul>
              <li> For orders of 1 box, there will be a delivery charge of $5.
              </li>
              <li> For orders of 2 boxes and above, delivery will be <em>free-of-charge</em>, absorbed by us.
